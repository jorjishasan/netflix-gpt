Suppose I have three components <Header/>, <Browse/>, <Login/>

I want <Header/> to be stick on each navigation. Navigations are like:

- if path is "/" it will render 'Login' component
- if path is "/Browse" it will render 'Browse' component

Tools i've used here 'react-router-dom', Now configure the routing In top level Component 'App.js'
